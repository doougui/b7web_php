		Then Hidesato called to the Dragon
		King to come out with him on the
		balcony, because the centipede was
		dead and he had nothing more to
		fear. Then all the inhabitants of the
		palace came out with joy, and
		Hidesato pointed to the lake. There
		lay the body of the dead centipede
		floating on the water, which was
		dyed red with its blood.
		The gratitude of the Dragon King
		was unlimited. The whole family
		came and bowed down before the
		warrior, calling him their hero and
		the bravest warrior in all of Japan.
		Another feast was prepared, more
		sumptuous than the first.
		All kinds of fish, prepared in every imaginable way, 
		raw, stewed, boiled and roasted, 
		served on coral trays and crystal dishes, 
		were put before him, and the wine was the best that
		Hidesato had ever tasted in his life.
		To add to the beauty of everything,
		the sun shone brightly, the lake
		glittered like a liquid diamond, and
		the palace was a thousand times
		more beautiful by day than by night.
